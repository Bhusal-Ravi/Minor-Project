# Land Registration System Using Blockchain

# About

The Land Registration System Using Blockchain is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. 
It aims to revolutionize the traditional land registration process by leveraging blockchain technology. 

### Drawbacks of the traditional system
 
   *  Traditional system prone to fraud and manipulation.   
   *  Slow and cumbersome process for property transfer.
   *  Manual paperwork leads to inefficiencies and delays.
   *  Lack of transparency in property ownership records.     
   *  Involvement of third parties in the process of purchase increases the costs.
   *  Difficulty in resolving disputes due to centralized control.
   *  Risk of data loss or corruption in centralized databases.

By using the blockchain technology, we can avoid all the drawbacks of the traditional system. As blockchain is an immutable and decentralized ledger, all the transactions that happened through the blockchain are transparent, unalterable, and secure. <br>
So, No one can get the false ownership by altering the data, and transferring the ownership of the property from one person to another person can be done without involvement of any third parties and government in a secure, transparent, and within no time.
